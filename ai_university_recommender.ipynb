            "    *   **Document projects:** Take photos, videos, and write brief descriptions of their projects, including the challenges faced and how they overcame them. This can form a personal portfolio.\n",
            "    *   **Attend workshops or online courses:** Look for local workshops on Arduino, 3D printing, or coding, or complete relevant online courses (e.g., Coursera, edX).\n",
